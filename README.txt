NOTES ABOUT CODE EXECUTION:

Minetest engine only runs the "init.lua" file on its own. From the init.lua file I have included code to run three other files of code. 

IF YOU WANT TO READ THE CODE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM YOU HAVE TO READ IT STARTING WITH init.lua THEN READ THE CODE IT RUNS (via dofile commands)

"functions.lua" and "nodedef.lua" are the only important files for this project (the third file "crafting.lua" handles something added for completeness rather than the constraints of the project)

All other files are present because it is normal and standard practice to have them in a mod such as this.
